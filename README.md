Kidlap-Kidlap is a VJ app for artists and a video player for video installations.
It is free and open-source, and can be an alternative to expensive software like Resolume Arena and TouchDesigner.

"Kidlap" is a Bisaya term for "blink," and "kidlap-kidlap" means "blinking."

It is under development and built using standard web technologies, allowing access to all modern browser APIs.

In Resolume, it is difficult to integrate standard shaders, and in TouchDesigner, it is hard to package the software for kiosk setups. We aim to solve these problems.

At the moment, it has limited features, and we need your help to test the software.

plans:
drop directly your image, gifs, videos, canvas animations and webgpu shaders.
